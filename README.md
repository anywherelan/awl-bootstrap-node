# awl-bootstrap-node

This project implements a bootstrap node â€” a well-known, stable peer that helps new nodes join the P2P network by providing initial connection information. It supports DHT, traffic relaying, and NAT traversal. [Here's](https://github.com/anywherelan/awl#how-it-works) a bit more information about it.

The Anywherelan project maintains a list of initial bootstrap nodes, which can be found [here](https://github.com/anywherelan/awl/blob/v0.12.0/config/other.go#L32-L40). However, you can help the community by setting up your own!

## Getting started

To build this project, you will need a Go compiler with a version of 1.24 or higher.

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build
```

First, you need to generate example config.
```bash
./awl-bootstrap-node -generate-config
# you can also provide a config name using arg -config-name=config-2.yaml
```

It will print something like this:
```
Generated example config file: config.yaml
Below are addresses that can be used to connect to this bootstrap node
Replace 127.0.0.1 or ::1 with appropriate IP addresses. If you don't have IPv6 support, just skip it

/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/6150/p2p/12D3KooWKubLLHV1WFkfzAcj9h2AuGNGsRkoztQZQVPsL1Khi2Hg
/ip4/127.0.0.1/udp/6150/quic-v1/p2p/12D3KooWKubLLHV1WFkfzAcj9h2AuGNGsRkoztQZQVPsL1Khi2Hg
/ip6/::1/tcp/7250/p2p/12D3KooWKubLLHV1WFkfzAcj9h2AuGNGsRkoztQZQVPsL1Khi2Hg
/ip6/::1/udp/7250/quic-v1/p2p/12D3KooWKubLLHV1WFkfzAcj9h2AuGNGsRkoztQZQVPsL1Khi2Hg
```

This configuration file `config.yaml` is ready to use. It will listen on the 0.0.0.0 address and has default community bootstrap peers.


It needs a `config.yaml` file near the binary to run.
```bash
./awl-bootstrap-node
```

To use this server with your `awl` client, you need to modify `bootstrapPeers` field in the `config_awl.json` file, which is located [here](https://github.com/anywherelan/awl#config-file-location).

Example:
```json
{
  "p2pNode": {
    "peerId": "REDACTED",
    "name": "REDACTED",
    "identity": "REDACTED",
    "bootstrapPeers": [
      "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/6150/p2p/12D3KooWKubLLHV1WFkfzAcj9h2AuGNGsRkoztQZQVPsL1Khi2Hg"
    ]
  },
.... other fields are omitted
}
```
